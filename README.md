# University of California, San Diego (UCSD) - COGS18: Introduction to Python
This repository contains my experince taking COGS18 (WI'22) [Introduction to Python] as taught by Prof. [Shannon Ellis](http://shanellis.com) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). It is a hands-on programming course, focused on teaching students in Cognitive Science and related disciplines an introduction on how to productively use Python.

## COURSE OVERVIEW

Welcome to COGS 18! The core goal of this class is to teach you introductory, hands-on skills for computer programming, specifically using the Python programming language. The course aims to do so in a way that fits well within the cognitive science department, using particularly-relevant use cases. COGS 18's approach is to focus on programming as a tool and to get you started with the necessary background and basic skills required to get you reading and writing code. The course aims to provide you with a strong foundation so that you can continue programming after you leave the class, applying the skills you learn to your domain or topic of interest.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course it was expected that I would be able to:

- Read basic Python programs, recognizing the structures used (i.e. variables, conditionals, loops, functions) and explaining how they work
- Write Python code to solve basic computational problems
- Debug small Python programs by identifying and fixing the bug(s)
- Execute Python programs in Jupyter notebooks and from Python scripts 
- Demonstrate familiarity with the command line 
- Describe and implement best practices (code style, documentation, and testing) in Python
