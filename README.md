# University of California, San Diego - COGS18: Introduction to Python
This repository contains my run with COGS18 (WI'22) [Introduction to Python] as taught by Prof. Ellis at the University of California, San Diego. 

## COURSE OVERVIEW

This is COGS 18! The core goal of this class is to teach you introductory, hands-on skills for computer programming, specifically using the Python programming language. The course aims to do so in a way that fits well within the cognitive science department, using particularly-relevant use cases. Our approach is to focus on programming as a tool and to get you started with the necessary background and basic skills required to get you reading and writing code. The course aims to provide you with a strong foundation so that you can continue programming after you leave the class, applying the skills you learn to your domain or topic of interest.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course it was expected that we would be able to:

- Read basic Python programs, recognizing the structures used (i.e. variables, conditionals, loops, functions) and explaining how they work
- Write Python code to solve basic computational problems
- Debug small Python programs by identifying and fixing the bug(s)
- Execute Python programs in Jupyter notebooks and from Python scripts 
- Demonstrate familiarity with the command line 
- Describe and implement best practices (code style, documentation, and testing) in Python 

Example scripts and notebooks throughout this respoistory will be related to cognitive science, focusing on data analysis, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and programmatic thinking.
